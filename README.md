# FavorBuddy

A [Nx](https://nx.dev/) monorepo supporting a Vite React SPA and Express Back-end - all written in Typescript.

They are split into 3 repos:

- **buddy**: is the Express repo
- **buddy-e2e**: is the E2E testing repo
- **favor**: is the Vite React SPA repo

It's currently a work in progress. You can learn more on [my website](https://www.yourlocaldev.com/projects).
